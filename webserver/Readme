The scripts in "RNASeq_pipeline.sh" are used to preprocess the RNA-Seq data(from "fastq" to "reads") in four major steps: quality control; mapping; bam file sorting; quantification. After that, the scripts in "HTSeq_stat.R" were used for merging the expression of immune receptor gene families and data normalization.

Notes:
1, For paired end sequencing data, the name of two fastq files should be ended with "_1.fastq" and "_2.fastq"; for single end sequencing data, the name for the single fastq file should ended with ".fastq". However, you can also modify our script according to your data.

2, You can download the lattest gtf and fastq file to build the reference data because there is duplicate gene symbols in previous versions.
   
3, You should better evaluate the data quality by checking the result in the directory of "old_fastqc" and "new_fastqc". As our scripts will run all preprocessing steps at one time, the expression profile of those low quality data (For examble: high duplicating rates, low sequencing length et.al) should be removed as usual RNA-Seq analysis.

4, You should make sure the common genes bewteen the signature matrix and tissue expression profile is enough. You'd better process the raw sequencing data according to our pipeline here.

5, The transcriptomal matrices should be separated by ",", "/t" or " " and the duplicated gene names should be removed before submit your job to our server.

6, For RNA-Seq data, reads counts calculated from HTSeq are used in our model. FPKM and TPM are not suggested in our web server.

7ï¼ŒIf you cannnot access our webserver from the link:http://wap-lab.org:3200/immune/, you can open it from: http://218.4.234.74:3200/immune/

8, If the result page URL emailed to you can not open, please do not close the work page and download the result from it untill the job is finished.

9, Software used in our paper were as follow,
  FastQC v0.11.4
  Trimmomatic-0.35
  STAR-2.5.2a 
  samtools-1.3.1
  RSeQC-2.6.3
  HTseq 0.6.1p1
  
10, Signature matrix developed for RNA-Seq data was included in this directory, named "SignatureMatrix.rnaseq.csv".
