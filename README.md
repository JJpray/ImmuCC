Notes for your sample data:

1, NA should not appeared in the first column of Gene names.

2, Duplicated gene names should be removed before submitting your data.

3, Number of signature genes in your sample should not be too small, because we should make sure th signature genes specific for each cell type is enough.

4, Other quantification units like FPKM, TPM are not suggested for your data becuase our training data are quantified with read counts.
