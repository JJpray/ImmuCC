Notes for the RNA-Seq data:

1, NA should not appeared in the first column of Gene names.

2, Duplicated gene names should be removed before submitting your data.

3, Number of signature genes in your sample should not be too small, because we should make sure th signature genes specific for each cell type is enough.

4, Other quantification units like FPKM, TPM are not suggested for seq_ImmuCC becuase our training data are quantified with read counts.

5, The link to the final result page delivered to you can not open now since our server has been moved to a new sites. You can view and download the result directly from the submitting page.

6, Sometimes the server will start to run and then stop at a few seconds when there are too many works in our computer cluster. You can try it again in some other times.

7, If the number of samples included in the submited expression matrix was too large, the task will stop in a few seconds. Please split your data into some smaller files.
