1, The pipeline for preprocessing bulk RNA-Seq data were the same as the methods used in Seq-ImmuCC which was available at our web site
https://github.com/wuaipinglab/ImmuCC/tree/master/webserver. The fastq format transcriptome sequencing data can be analysed with it to produce the gene expression matrix of your sample.

2, The tissue specific training signature matrix constructed in our tissue specific model were available at https://github.com/wuaipinglab/ImmuCC/tree/master/tissue_immucc/SignatureMatrix. You can download the correspondent training signature matrix according to the tissue of your sample.

3, With the
